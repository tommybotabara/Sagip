# Sagip
Sagip is a distress alarming application that can save lives through emergency contacting trusted contacts and gestures a panic button. This app sends out SMS messages to trusted contacts. The app sounds out a loud blaring sound to signal a distress call from the environment.

Most of the time, when we wander the streets alone. There is always a lurking danger of bad elements nearby and we feel unsafe. Sagip exists to provide you and your loved ones assurance that someone will hear your call whenever you are in danger. By clicking the volume up or down button for four consecutive times, an alarm will blare off at full volume. If the loud alarm falls into deaf ears, the app will automatically blast S.O.S SMS to your selected contacts and plot a report on the web, as well as notify app users nearby. After turning off the alarm, you will be prompted to fill out a report to help other people know that a crime incident has occurred in your location. Or you can just report it as a false alarm!
